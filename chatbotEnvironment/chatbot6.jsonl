Once you have entered this information, click the 'build path', button to generate your route. A box with text directions will appear, and the path will also be highlighted on the map. If you need to switch between floors, you can use the buttons on the side of the map to do so. The map supports multiple floors, so you can easily navigate between different levels of the building. Additionally, there is a filter button that allows you to filter out location names based on your input. Is there anything else I can help you with?"}
