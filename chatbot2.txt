User: Hi, I need help finding my way around the hospital.
Chatbot: Sure, I'd be happy to help. Do you want to use the navigation component?
User: Yes, please.
Chatbot: To use the map page, you first need to navigate to the pathfinding page by clicking on the Navigation button in the menu. On the pathfinding page, you can enter the start and end location of your route, along with the algorithm you want to use for pathfinding. Once you have entered this information, click the "build path" button to generate your route. A box with text directions will appear, and the path will also be highlighted on the map. If you need to switch between floors, you can use the buttons on the side of the map to do so. The map supports multiple floors, so you can easily navigate between different levels of the building. Additionally, there is a filter button that allows you to filter out location names based on your input. Is there anything else you need help with?
